Did you know
I could claim the dreamer from the dream?
Make you feel
Everything you've never even seen
Yeah, it's been
A long, a long, a long, a long, a long-long
You were my
Favourite for a long time
Stitch and fall
The faces rearranged
You will see
Beauty give the way to something strange
Yeah, it's been
A long, a long, a long, a long, a long-long
You were my
Favourite for a long time
Well, look who's just the newest clown
35 hours coming down
How the sun shines on new pavement
And you don't even feel it
It's a cry far from bed radios
And days spent playing football indoors
When they painted town with Thatcher
And they never even wanted to know ya
Feel alone?
I can split the sunshine to the day
Yeah, and
Stick your heart to everything you say
Yeah
To be gone, be gone, be gone, be gone, be gone
You were my favourite for a long time
You were my favourite for a long time
Favourite for a long time
Favourite for a long time
Favourite for a long time
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) all the pieces last forever
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) all the pieces last forever
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) and all the pieces
Dara-dara-dara-dara-dara
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa) and all the pieces
Dara-da, dara-da
Did you know
Cities on the side are often strange?
Yeah, and now
Every time you blink, you feel it change
And it's been
A long, a long, a long, a long, long-long
You've been my
Favourite for a while
Ah, it makes sense when you understand
The misery made me another marked man
And I'm always looking over my shoulder
And each new day, I get another year older
Shoulder bound to the frame of a door?
Chewed into shape like a stone on the shore
But if there was lightning in me
You'd know who it was for
Did you know
I could claim the dreamer from the dream?
Make you feel
Everything you've never even seen
Yeah, it's been
A long, a long, a long, a long, long-long
You were my
Favourite for a long time
You were my favourite for a long time
You were my favourite for a long time
You were my favourite for a long time
